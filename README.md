# music-genre-detector
This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to detect the genre of music from audio files. The model is trained using the GTZan dataset, which consists of audio files in .wav format. The GTZan dataset includes a variety of music genres such as blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. The aim of this project is to create a product that allows users to input audio files of their choosing and receive the predicted genre as output.
